            Better traffic for your vendors. More fun for your attendees.
            And MORE POTENTIAL PROFIT!
            That’s what CASHHOPPERS can mean to your trade show.
            Better traffic, and fun show elements that engage and entertain the people in attendance
            are key values you must deliver with every show. CASHHOPPERS delivers both.
            Exhibitors increase booth traffic and guest interest. Players get into the competitive
            spirit and scramble to WIN CASH and other prizes.
          %br
            You can also enjoy a PROFIT from CASHHOPPERS. Instead of paying for a giant,
            distracting, and expensive trade show mobile app… use CASHHOPPERS to offer
            your vendors marketing and advertising opportunities they have never had before.

          %br
            You earn a profit on every vendor that participates, as well as a commission on all
            in-show advertising sales. Once you reach the minimum participation levels,
            everything after that brings more profit to you!

          %br
            %b GOT BIG SCREEN CAPABILITIES?
            Hook a big screen up to CASHHOPPERS during your show, and we can display a
            real-time montage of photos AS THEY ARE BEING SUBMITTED! Attendees LOVE
            seeing themselves on the big screen and vendors LOVE seeing their products and
            people up there too… so if you have the capabilities, tell us you want the
            CASHHOPPERS Big Screen Option
